><b>Hi there :wave:, I'm Taron</b></h3>
  <p align="left" >
I am a skilled React developer with 5+ years of experience in designing and building user interfaces for web applications. My passion lies in creating high-quality, responsive, and scalable web applications that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. I am well-versed in the latest web development technologies and frameworks, including React, Redux, and Node.js, and I enjoy keeping up with the latest trends and techniques in the industry.

I am a problem-solver by nature, and I take pride in my ability to work independently or as part of a team to deliver innovative solutions that meet client requirements. I have a keen eye for detail, and I believe that the key to success lies in understanding the client's needs and goals, and delivering solutions that exceed their expectations.

I am always open to new challenges and opportunities, and I am excited to work with like-minded individuals and organizations to create cutting-edge web applications that push the boundaries of what is possible.
